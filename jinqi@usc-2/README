CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

1.The outside code resources students will be allowed to use in assignments for this class are limited to code written by the course staff for the purposes of helping students in the course, or code from the textbook for this course.

2. What is the probability of each of the three outcomes in a trial: two heads, one head and one tail, and two tails? Why is one of them different than the other two?
P(two heads) = 1/4
P(one head and one Tail) = 1/2
P(two tails) = 1/4
The probilitity of getting one head and one tail is higer than the other two because the event of two tosses will have 4 outcomes and there are no order between two tosses, TT,TH,HT,HH is all the possible situation, therefore the event of one head and one tail is more likely to happen.

3.Roughly how many trials do you need to do before you mostly get results within 1% of these probabilities? Do several simulations using your program to determine an answer to this. You just need a general order of magnitude, not an exact answer.

About 800 trials.

4.Roughly how many trials can you do before it crashes with an overflow error?

The limit of jave integer is -2147483648 ï½ž 2147483647. Here it crashes after 10^9.
